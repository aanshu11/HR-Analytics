## Overview  

Welcome to the HR Analytics Dashboard project! This Power BI dashboard is designed to empower HR teams with actionable insights into workforce demographics, employee retention, turnover, and headcount trends. The interactive visualizations enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for improving organizational efficiency, reducing turnover, and planning workforce strategies.  

## Problem Statement  

The primary objectives of this project are:  
- Track employee headcount trends over time.  
- Analyze employee turnover by job level, department, and demographics.  
- Identify key factors contributing to employee departures.  
- Measure employee retention and turnover rates.  
- Provide an interactive dashboard for HR stakeholders to slice and dice data across various dimensions.  

## Features  

- **Dynamic Headcount Analysis:** Monitor active employees by job level, department, and location.  
- **Turnover Insights:** Analyze turnover trends, reasons for departures, and termination types.  
- **Retention Metrics:** Track retention rates over time and identify key retention drivers.  
- **Demographic Breakdown:** Visualize workforce data by gender, age, and remote/on-site work distribution.  
- **Top/Bottom Earners Analysis:** Conditional formatting to highlight the highest and lowest earners.  
- **Interactive Filters and Tooltips:** Enable slicing data and providing contextual insights across dimensions.  

## Steps Followed  

### 1. **Data Preparation in Power Query**  
- Imported raw data into Power BI using Power Query.  
- Cleaned and transformed datasets to standardize formats, fill missing values, and remove duplicates.  
- Established relationships between fact and dimension tables for a robust data model.  

### 2. **Data Model Creation**  
- Built a star schema for efficient querying and analysis.  
- Defined key relationships between employee fact tables and supporting dimensions like date, department, and job level.

### 3. **DAX Measures Development**  
Developed advanced DAX measures to calculate key metrics. Below are some of the key DAX measures used in the project:  

#### **Headcount**  
```DAX  
Headcount =  
CALCULATE(  
    [All_Employees],  
    FILTER(  
        people_fact,  
        people_fact[hire_date] <= LASTDATE('Date'[Date]) &&  
        (  
            people_fact[term_date] > LASTDATE('Date'[Date]) ||  
            ISBLANK(people_fact[term_date])  
        )  
    )  
)  
```  

#### **Starting Headcount**  
```DAX  
Starting Headcount =  
CALCULATE(  
    [All_Employees],  
    FILTER(  
        people_fact,  
        people_fact[hire_date] < FIRSTDATE('Date'[Date]) &&  
        (ISBLANK(people_fact[term_date]) || people_fact[term_date] >= FIRSTDATE('Date'[Date]))  
    )  
)  
```  

#### **Ending Headcount**  
```DAX  
Ending Headcount =  
CALCULATE(  
    [All_Employees],  
    FILTER(  
        people_fact,  
        people_fact[hire_date] < FIRSTDATE('Date'[Date]) &&  
        (ISBLANK(people_fact[term_date]) || people_fact[term_date] >= LASTDATE('Date'[Date]))  
    )  
)  
```  

#### **Retention Rate**  
```DAX  
Retention =  
DIVIDE(  
    [Ending Headcount],  
    [Starting Headcount],  
    0  
) * 100  
```  

#### **Departing Employees**  
```DAX  
Departing Employees =  
CALCULATE(  
    [All_Employees],  
    FILTER(  
        people_fact,  
        people_fact[term_date] >= FIRSTDATE('Date'[Date]) &&  
        people_fact[term_date] <= LASTDATE('Date'[Date])  
    )  
)  
```  

#### **Turnover %**  
```DAX  
Turnover % =  
DIVIDE(  
    [Departing Employees],  
    [Avg # of Employees],  
    0  
) * 100  
```  

### 4. **Dashboard Creation**
